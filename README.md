How project work

1. We can get scrapping details from youtube v3 link: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3
2. After getting details about what to scrape and how to scrape we jump into python

Python:-
1. In python we need to import libraries like from

googleapiclient.discovery import build
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import streamlit as st

How it work:
I've used a basic if elif concept where i need to showcase two pages FAQ and Scrapping as i get a dropdown input from user as per user wish the rest of process will continue

afer in FAQ sql quries has been used depends upon user FAQ's
and using pymysql I've connected the database to establish required output

In the case of scrapping
I've used google client and API key 

To make the website I've used streamlit

I hope you like the information ✌️😊
